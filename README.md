# All Star


**Somebody once told me**

>*The world is gonna roll me*

~~I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed~~


1. She was looking kinda dumb
	- With her finger and her thumb
		- In shape of an "L" on her forehead


Well
- the years start coming
	- and they don't stop coming
* fed to the rules 
	- and I hit the ground running 


```
print("Didn't make sense")
print("Not to live for fun")
a = "smart"
b = "dumb"
print("Your brain gets ", a, "but your head gets ", b)
```


*So much to do,* `print(" so much to see")`
*So what's wrong* `print(" with taking the back street")`


**You'll never know if you don't go**

***You'll never shine if you don't glow***


Hey now
1. You're an all star
2. Get your game on
3. Go play

Hey now
1. You're a rock star
2. Get the show on
3. Get paid


*All that glitters is gold*

*Only shooting stars break the mold~*

| It's a | cool | place |
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| and  | they | say   |
| it      | gets | colder|


```py
def verse(a, b):
    result = a + b
    return result

a = "You're bundled up now, "
b = "wait 'til you get older"

print(verse(a, b))
```


- [x] But the meteor men [^1] beg to differ
- [ ] Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
- [ ] The ice we skate has gotten pretty thin
- [x] The water's getting warm so you might as well swim


My world's on fire :fire: how 'bout yours? :point_right:
That's the way I like it :100: and I'll never get bored :sunglasses:


[^1]: Often misinterpreted as "media men". "Meteor men" might be referring to meteorologists - weathermen don’t think the world is getting colder, and thus, the “hole” could possibly be referring to the ozone layer (https://genius.com).
