# All Star


**Somebody once told me**

>*The world is gonna roll me*

~~I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed~~

- She was looking kinda dumb
	- With her finger and her thumb
		- In shape of an "L" on her forehead


Well
- the years start coming
	- and they don't stop coming
* fed to the rules 
	- and I hit the ground running 

```
print("Didn't make sense")
print("Not to live for fun")
a = "smart"
b = "dumb"
print("Your brain gets ", a, "but your head gets ", b)
```

*So much to do,* `print(" so much to see")`
*So what's wrong* `print(" with taking the back street")`

You'll never know if you don't go

You'll never shine if you don't glow

1. Hey now
	- You're an all star
	- Get your game on
		- Go play
2. Hey now
	- You're a rock star
	- Get your show on
		- Get paid
