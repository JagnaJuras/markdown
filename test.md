# Checklist

- [x] But the meteor men [^1] beg to differ
- [ ] Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
- [ ] The ice we skate has gotten pretty thin
- [x] The water's getting warm so you might as well swim

# Emoji

My world's on fire :fire: how 'bout yours? :point_right:
That's the way I like it :100: and I'll never get bored :sunglasses:




[^1]: Often misinterpreted as "media men". "Meteor men" might be referring to meteorologists - weathermen don’t think the world is getting colder, and thus, the “hole” could possibly be referring to the ozone layer (https://genius.com).
